show the structure of a typical thesis with some notes on the content
and purpose of each part.  The notes are meant to be informative but
not necessarily illustrative; for example, this paragraph is not
really an abstract, because it contains information not found

\chapter{Introduction}

The efficiency of livestock in converting feed to weight gained is an important metric for livestock managers. This metric allows the identification of animals that can efficiently gain weight which can influence the livestock manager's selective breeding strategy in order to optimise economic meat production. 

Conversion of feed to red meat in livestock is inherently inefficient in terms of feed intake to weight gain. For beef, current estimates of the ratio of feed intake to weight gain are between 5:1 and 10:1 \cite{Garnett2009}. Opportunities to improve this efficiency through genetic controls such as breed substitution, crossbreeding and genetic selection exist \cite{Hill2012} but data that shows how efficient individual animals are at converting feed to meat is essential in knowing which livestock to breed. 

This data forms part of an animal's phenotype. The phenotype is the set of characteristics of an individual animal that are a result of both its genetics and environment. By measuring aspects of a particular animal's phenotype, information pertaining to how efficient that animal is at converting feed to weight can be found. This phenotype information can be used to extrapolate information about the genome which allows for the development of selection criteria for breeding objectives \cite{Pollak2012}. 

However, this specific livestock phenotype information is difficult to empirically obtain and there is currently a lack of data available. Current recording techniques have focused mainly on animals in feedlots, where the animals are kept in pens and fed \textit{ad libitum} at regulated times \cite{Arthur2005}.

This difficulty is compounded when considering livestock in pasture. Livestock in pasture feed directly from the pasture so it is not possible to regulate feeding times. Manually measuring feed intake of livestock in pasture is not practical as it would require significant manpower. Even in feedlots, where the process of measuring intake is easier because of the controlled way in which feeding is conducted, the cost of manpower is cited as the main reason for current lack of recording \cite{Barwick2010}. Furthermore, since heritability is both a property of the population and the environment \cite{Falconer1996}, measuring the traits of livestock in feedlots would not necessarily capture the traits of the same livestock in pasture. Attempts to capture this data through the use of chemical  markers to measure pasture intake in studies have met with some success \cite{Barlow2009} \cite{Dove2006}; however, chemical markers have limitations and can only be used for short time periods. Therefore, to gain a robust understanding of the phenotype of individual animals, longer time periods of intake measurement are needed.

In recent decades there has been advancement in the development of small, low power sensor devices. These devices have allowed scientists to create non-invasive devices that can be used to collect movement traces of free-ranging animals \cite{Anthony2012}. It has been suggested that this data could be used for livestock behaviour classification \cite{Guo2006}; however developing a practical measure of intake for livestock in pasture currently remains a serious challenge \cite{Cottle2013}. Using these sensors as a method to automate the collective of phenotype information to assist in the process of selective breeding would be valuable to the livestock industry. Such a method would not only assist in decision making for selective breeding opportunities but could also assist in the management of livestock health since livestock managers would be able to overview livestock behaviour. 

The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have previously developed devices that can non intrusively fit onto livestock and collect signal data including inertial measurements and GPS \cite{Guo2006}. There is a potential for these devices to be used for classifying livestock phenotypes. The aim of thesis is to explore the feasibility of using such sensors to develop an automated method for the collection of livestock phenotype information pertaining to pasture intake. 


\chapter{Literature review / prior art}

You will need to review previous work in the field, which may include
books and papers (``literature''), patents and commercial products
(``prior art''), and earlier work in your Department.  This
information is usually (but not always) collected in a single chapter,
whose title should preferably be more specific and interesting than
the one above.

\chapter{Theory}

A scientific paper is likely to be read by people who are not
specialists in the same field as the author(s), but who nevertheless
may need to use the results of the paper in their own fields.
Similarly, the examiners of your thesis will probably include at least
one academic who does not teach or conduct research in the subject
area of your thesis.  In an early chapter of your thesis, therefore,
you should quote any theoretical results which are necessary for the
understanding of later chapters.  Examiners who are not specialists in
your area will know whether you have given sufficient theoretical
information.  They will also know whether you have insulted their
status by presenting material which is familiar to every
half-competent graduate in every field of ECE.

\section{Data curation}

- data is from 2 experiments in big ridge: experiment 4 and experiment 5
	- both experiments had two cows in two separate plots
		- each cow with halter tag and ear tag	
		- sometimes tags failed and were replaced	
	- exp 4 had audio, acceleration, magnometer, gyroscope sensors, exp 5 + gps	
	- sensor data logged to sd card with tdf data format: %%https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783319030708-c2.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-1435816-p176319219&ei=gMxpU_iHBIfgkAWq1YDQBw&usg=AFQjCNFGliHfajzeoJYh2Q0iheHXQL4rYg&sig2=YWKuQam_2SCF0zTtXTrc3w&bvm=bv.66111022,d.dGI
	
- in addition, video was taken for annotation purposes.
	- videos focused on a particular cow but sometimes both cows in shot

\subsection{Data conversion and storage}

- lots of binary data from multiple sensor nodes stored in tdf data format
- need to convert into hdf5 for ease of access, access over the web
	- one h5 file per experiment
	- format of h5 file:
		- one group per node	
		- one table per sensor	
		- each row is utc time and then sensor reading
- used BLOSC compression (~10x compression achieved)
- accessing over web interface was then possible 
- audio a bit tricky as to save space 16 sample written with one timestamp. spacing between audio found by finding the 'average' sample rate 
	- also a bit tricky as to save space saved either as raw, as differences or as a 'silent page'

\subsection{Data coverage plotting}

- To get an idea for annotation of where the data was located, script was written to find what periods of time the data covered and where there were gaps
- this was plotted along with the video data in order to focus on areas where there was data for all sensors
- these good periods can then be annotated

% Chapters after the \appendix command are lettered, not numbered.
% Setting apart the appendices in the table of contents is awkward:

\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Appendices}
\mbox{}
\newpage

% The \mbox{} command between two \newpage commands gives a blank page.
% In the contents, the ``Appendices'' heading is shown as being on this
% blank page, which is the page before the first appendix.  This stops the
% first appendix from be listed ABOVE the word ``Appendices'' in the
% table of contents.

% \include appendix chapters here.

\chapter{Dummy appendix}

Appendices are useful for supplying necessary details or explanations
which do not seem to fit into the main text, perhaps because they are
too long and would distract the reader from the central argument.
Appendices are also used for program listings.

Notice that appendices are ``numbered'' with capital letters, not
numerals.  When the \verb+\appendix+ command in
\LaTeX~\cite[p.\,175]{lamport} is used with the \texttt{book} document
class, it causes subsequent chapters to be treated as appendices.

\chapter{Program listings}

\section{First program}

Some initial explanatory notes may precede the listing.

\section{Second program}

\section{Etc.}

\chapter{Companion disk}

If you wish to make some computer files available to your examiners,
you can list and describe the files here.  The files can be supplied
on a disk and inserted in a pocket fixed to the inside back cover.

The disk will not be needed if you can specify a URL from which the
files can be downloaded.
