abstract = {After two decades of developing DNA-based tools for selection, we are at an interesting juncture. Genomic technology has essentially eliminated the potentially large negative impact of spontaneous single-mutation genetic defects as the management of recent examples in beef cattle have demonstrated.Wehave the ability to perform more accurate selection based on molecular breeding values (MBVs) for animals closely related to the discovery population. Yet the amount of genetic variation explained falls short of expectations held for the technology. Tests are less effective in distant relatives within a breed and are not robust enough for across-breed use. It is hypothesised that ‘larger single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels’ will help extend the effective use of tests to more distantly related animals and across breeds. Sequencing and imputing sequences across individuals will enable us to discover causative mutations or SNPs in perfect harmony with the mutation. However, the investment to revisit discovery populations will be large.Wecan ill afford to duplicate genotyping or sequencing activities for prominent individuals. Hence, a global strategy for genotyping and sequencing becomes an attractive proposition asmanyof our livestock populations are related. Aswelearned more of the complexities of the genome, the number of animals in discovery populations necessary to achieve high levels of predictability has grown dramatically.No one organisation has the resources to assemble the animals needed, especially for novel, expensive or hard to measure phenotypes. This scenario is fertile ground for increased international collaboration in all livestock species.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a novel method to analyze and recognize automatically sound signals of chewing and biting. For the automatic segmentation and classification of acoustical ingestive behaviour of sheep the method use an appropriate acoustic representation and statistical modelling based on hidden Markov models. We analyzed 1813 s of chewing data from four sheep eating two different forages typically found in grazing production systems, orchardgrass and alfalfa, each at two sward heights. Because identification of species consumed when in mixed swards is a key issue in grazing science, we tested the possibility to discriminate species and sward height by using the proposed approach. Signals were correctly classified by forage and sward height in 67\% of the cases, whereas forage was correctly identified 84\% of the time. The results showed an overall performance of 82\% for the recognition of chewing events. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present paper reviews estimation methods for measuring pasture intake of individual grazing animals, in particular, the use of indigestible plant markers. Natural alkanes and alcohols function essentially as an internal marker and thus accommodate differences in forage digestibility among individuals and those arising from interactions between supplement and forage. An estimate of diet composition partitions total intake into its component plant species. Estimates of diet composition require correction for incomplete faecal marker recovery, where relative recoveries (i.e. the recovery of the alkanes relative to each other) suffice. If estimates of whole-diet digestibility are also wanted, actual faecal alkane recoveries must be used. Using known labelled supplement intakes as a means of estimating the intake of all other diet components avoids the need to dose animals separately with synthetic alkanes. The results, problems and possible workarounds for a commercial system under development to estimate individual animal pasture intakes using known labelled-supplement intakes are outlined. A prototype bin system was trialled and, despite many initial technological problems, it showed enough promise for Sapien Technology to continue to develop the system with Proway Livestock.},

abstract = {The paper presents an investigation into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for cattle monitoring. The proposed solution fulfils the requirement for intensive condition monitoring of individual animals, aggregation and timely reporting of data to the farm manager. The core contribution of this study is a wireless communication solution designed for both loose house dairy cattle and free ranging beef cattle. The design target utilises inexpensive, low power consumption sensor nodes as the base elements of a data gathering and communication infrastructure. This platform facilitates real-time data download for loose housed dairy cattle and non real-time communication for free ranging beef cattle where the former is more challenging. In order to meet the target objectives, both the hardware and software are designed to adapt to the deployment challenges which include mobility, radio path interference, short transmission range of sensor nodes and limited resources in terms of energy and storage. These challenges have been analysed and addressed. Laboratory experiments and farm trials have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the platform communication protocol. The results of experiments demonstrate that the platform performs efficiently while conforming to the limitations associated with WSN implementations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Automated animal behaviour monitoring systems have become increasingly appealing for research and animal production management purposes. However, many existing systems are suited to measure only one or two behaviour patterns or activity states at a time. We aimed to develop and pilot a method for automatically measuring and recognising several behavioural patterns of dairy cows using a three-dimensional accelerometer and a multi-class support vector machine (SVM). SVM classification models were constructed based on nine features. The models were trained using observations made of the behaviour of 30 cows fitted with a neck collar bearing an accelerometer that recorded horizontal, vertical and lateral acceleration. Measured behaviour patterns included standing, lying, ruminating, feeding, normal and lame walking, lying down, and standing up. Accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and kappa measures were used to evaluate the model performance. The SVM classification models achieved a reasonable recognition of standing (80\% sensitivity, 65\% precision), lying (80\%, 83\%), ruminating (75\%, 86\%), feeding (75\%, 81\%), walking normally (79\%,79\%), and lame walking (65\%,66\%). The results were poor for lying down (0\%, 0\%) and standing up (71\%, 29\%). The overall performance of the multi-class model was 78\% precision with a kappa value of 0.69. Each of the behaviour categories had one or two other behaviour patterns that became confused with them the most. The problematic behaviours were expectedly those that resemble each other in terms of movement. Possible solutions for the problems in classification are presented. In conclusion, accelerometers can be used to easily recognise various behaviour patterns in dairy cows. Support vector machines proved useful in classification of measured behaviour patterns. However, further work is needed to refine the features used in the classification models in order to gain the best possible classification performance. Also the quality of acceleration data needs to be considered to improve the results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Animal welfare is an issue of great importance in modern food production systems. Because animal behavior provides reliable information about animal health and welfare, recent research has aimed at designing monitoring systems capable of measuring behavioral parameters and transforming them into their corresponding behavioral modes. However, network unreliability and high-energy consumption have limited the applicability of those systems. In this study, a 2.4-GHz ZigBee-based mobile ad hoc wireless sensor network (MANET) that is able to overcome those problems is presented. The designed MANET showed high communication reliability, low energy consumption and low packet loss rate (14.8\%) due to the deployment of modern communication protocols (e.g. multi-hop communication and handshaking protocol). The measured behavioral parameters were transformed into the corresponding behavioral modes using a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based artificial neural network (ANN). The best performance of the ANN in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) and the convergence speed was achieved when it was initialized and trained using the Nguyen-Widrow and Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithms, respectively. The success rate of behavior classification into five classes (i.e. grazing, lying down, walking, standing and others) was 76.2\% ($\sigma$ =1.06) on average. The results of this study showed an important improvement regarding the performance of the designed MANET and behavior classification compared to the results of other similar studies. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Livestock, particularly ruminants, can eat a wider range of biomass than humans. In the drive for greater efficiency, intensive systems of livestock production have evolved to compete with humans for high-energy crops such as cereals. Feeds consumed by livestock were analysed in terms of the quantities used and efficiency of conversion of grassland, human-edible ('edible') crops and crop by-products into milk, meat and eggs, using the United Kingdom as an example of a developed livestock industry. Some 42 million tonnes of forage dry matter were consumed from 2008 to 2009 by the UK ruminant livestock population of which 0.7 was grazed pasture and 0.3 million tonnes was conserved forage. In addition, almost 13 million tonnes of raw material concentrate feeds were used in the UK animal feed industry from 2008 to 2009 of which cereal grains comprised 5.3 and soyabean meal 1.9 million tonnes. The proportion of edible feed in typical UK concentrate formulations ranged from 0.36 for milk production to 0.75 for poultry meat production. Example systems of livestock production were used to calculate feed conversion ratios (FCR - feed input per unit of fresh product). FCR for concentrate feeds was lowest for milk at 0.27 and for the meat systems ranged from 2.3 for poultry meat to 8.8 for cereal beef. Differences in FCR between systems of meat production were smaller when efficiency was calculated on an edible input/output basis, where spring-calving/grass finishing upland suckler beef and lowland lamb production were more efficient than pig and poultry meat production. With the exception of milk and upland suckler beef, FCR for edible feed protein into edible animal protein were >1.0. Edible protein/animal protein FCR of 1.0 may be possible by replacing cereal grain and soyabean meal with cereal by-products in concentrate formulations. It is concluded that by accounting for the proportions of human-edible and inedible feeds used in typical livestock production systems, a more realistic estimate of efficiency can be made for comparisons between systems.},

We describe protocols for using the saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) of plant wax as markers for estimating fecal output, intake and digestibility. Procedures for investigating digestion kinetics are also discussed. Alkanes can also be used to estimate diet composition and the procedures required to do this are also described, including the special case where supplementary feed is treated as a component of the diet composition estimate. The long-chain alcohols (LCOHs) and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) of plant wax show particular promise for discriminating a greater number of species in the diet. The use of all these plant-wax markers in nutrition studies depends on having quantitative, repeatable and mutually compatible assay procedures for alkanes, LCOHs and VLCFAs; we present protocols for these assays in detail. Analysis of a single sample of feces or plant material for all these plant-wax markers can be completed within 2 days; however, it is possible to process up to 50 samples (analyzed in duplicate) per week.},

abstract = {Estimating forage intake by free-grazing livestock is difficult and expensive. Previous approaches include behavioral observation, ratio techniques using indigestible markers, mechanical recording of ingestive jaw motion, and acoustic recording of ingestive behaviors. Acoustic recording shows great potential but has been limited by the difficulty and time required to manually identify and classify ingestive events. We present an acoustic recording and analysis system that automatically detects, classifies, and quantifies ingestive events in free-grazing beef cattle. The system utilizes a wide-frequency acoustic microphone close to the animal's mouth, mathematical signal analysis to detect and measure ingestive events, and streaming data analysis capable of handling an unlimited amount of data. Analysis parameters can be reconfigured for different animals, forages and other changing conditions. The system measures the acoustic parameters of ingestive events, such as duration, amplitude, spectrum and energy, which can support further event classification and become the inputs to a forage intake model. We validated our detection and classification technique against the results of trained human observers based on field studies with grazing steer. The software detected 95\% of manually identified bites in an event-by-event comparison. Field observations and sound attenuation analysis indicate that sounds from adjacent livestock and ambient pastoral environments have an insignificant effect upon the integrity of the recorded acoustic data set. We conclude that wideband acoustic analysis allows us to identify ingestive events accurately and automatically over extended periods of time. © 2011.},

abstract = {Monitoring and describing the physical movements and body postures of animals is one of the most fundamental tasks of ethology. The more precise the observations are the more sophisticated the interpretations can be about the biology of a certain individual or species. Animal-borne data loggers have recently contributed much to the collection of motion-data from individuals, however, the problem of translating these measurements to distinct behavioural categories to create an ethogram is not overcome yet. The objective of the present study was to develop a "behaviour tracker": a system composed of a multiple sensor data-logger device (with a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope) and a supervised learning algorithm as means of automated identification of the behaviour of freely moving dogs. We collected parallel sensor measurements and video recordings of each of our subjects (Belgian Malinois, N=12; Labrador Retrievers, N=12) that were guided through a predetermined series of standard activities. Seven behavioural categories (lay, sit, stand, walk, trot, gallop, canter) were pre-defined and each video recording was tagged accordingly. Evaluation of the measurements was performed by support vector machine (SVM) classification. During the analysis we used different combinations of independent measurements for training and validation (belonging to the same or different individuals or using different training data size) to determine the robustness of the application. We reached an overall accuracy of above 90\% perfect identification of all the defined seven categories of behaviour when both training and validation data belonged to the same individual, and over 80\% perfect recognition rate using a generalized training data set of multiple subjects. Our results indicate that the present method provides a good model for an easily applicable, fast, automatic behaviour classification system that can be trained with arbitrary motion patterns and potentially be applied to a wide range of species and situations.},

abstract = {Genetic improvement strategies in the past have concentrated on traits associated with outputs. Traits that directly affect input costs, such as those related to the efficiency of feed utilisation, have only recently started to receive some attention. This paper examines the current state of knowledge, benefits and challenges associated with genetic improvement of feed utilisation by livestock. Current information indicates the existence of genetic variation in feed efficiency and moderate heritability for most feed efficiency traits in all livestock species. However, there is a paucity of information on the genetic relationships among feed efficiency traits and other traits at different phases of the production cycle. The challenge is to develop breeding programs that exploit genetic variation in efficiency of feed utilisation to improve whole production system efficiency. The cost of recording feed intake (used to compute feed efficiency traits) is high, making it uneconomical, in some species, to measure feed intake in all potential seedstock animals. However, where a two-stage selection approach has been adopted, the inclusion of feed efficiency traits in genetic improvement schemes has yielded substantial additional benefits over and above the benefits from existing schemes that do not include feed efficiency traits. Under a two-stage selection strategy all potential seedstock animals are first evaluated for the production traits of interest, after which strategically selected individuals undergo feed efficiency testing. Where physiological or genetic markers for feed efficiency exist, such information is included in the first stage selection decision. There is theoretical evidence that selection for some feed efficiency traits, such as residual feed intake, will have additional benefit of reducing greenhouse emissions by livestock and improving environmental sustainability. The challenge is to generate the necessary empirical data to support this assertion.},

abstract = {Research shows that livestock account for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global consumption of livestock products is growing rapidly. This paper reviews the life cycle analysis (LCA) approach to quantifying these emissions and argues that, given the dynamic complexity of our food system, it offers a limited understanding of livestock's GHG impacts. It is argued that LCA's conclusions need rather to be considered within a broader conceptual framework that incorporates three key additional perspectives. The first is an understanding of the indirect second order effects of livestock production on land use change and associated CO2 emissions. The second compares the opportunity cost of using land and resources to rear animals with their use for other food or non-food purposes. The third perspective is need-the paper considers how far people need livestock products at all. These perspectives are used as lenses through which to explore both the impacts of livestock production and the mitigation approaches that are being proposed. The discussion is then broadened to consider whether it is possible to substantially reduce livestock emissions through technological measures alone, or whether reductions in livestock consumption will additionally be required. The paper argues for policy strategies that explicitly combine GHG mitigation with measures to improve food security and concludes with suggestions for further research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Monitoring the eating habits and rumination of cattle is effective for evaluating forage values and making animal management decisions for stalls and grazing pastures. Acoustic monitoring is a feasible method to monitor these activities, but it requires automatic distinction and quantification of activities to gain broader application. This automatic distinction and quantification may be possible using a pattern matching method, which distinguishes jaw movements by extracting characteristic patterns from eating and ruminating, and then matches similar characteristic patterns in unanalyzed activities. The objectives of this study were to define an acoustic monitoring system with a single-axis acceleration sensor, to determine an effective sensor attachment site (i.e., the horn, forehead, or nasal bridge), and to assess the automatic classification of ingestive and ruminative chewing behaviors using a pattern matching method. Four beef cows fed Italian ryegrass silage were each recorded eating and ruminating for more than 60 and 20. min, respectively. The oscillatory waveforms generated while eating and ruminating were clearly recorded by the single-axis acceleration sensor, regardless of sensor attachment site. The pattern matching method correctly distinguished ingestive chewing with an accuracy of over 0.9, regardless of the sensor site (estimated number of chews by automatic detection/true number of chews by manual detection). Placement of the sensor on the horn of the animal resulted in the most matched measurement (0.99). In contrast, the method overestimated ruminating chewing time (approximately 1.50) because noises that occurred during idling were misclassified as ruminating chewing. The provision of an additional chewing criterion for automatic detection, i.e., chewing is performed consecutively (context-based cues), improved the classification accuracy of ruminating to a range of 1.02-1.08. In conclusion, automatic detection using a pattern matching method successfully classified ingestive chewing and ruminating chewing in cattle, and a single-axis acceleration sensor was useful for acoustic monitoring at all sensor attachment sites. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
