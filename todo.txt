Thesis to do:

Abstract:
    - Write the abstract
    - Poster would be a good place to start with it
    
Intro:

2. Background:
    - Add references for REST
    - Add references for JSON

    - DONE: Write about the rest of the technologies (eg: restful, python etc)
    - DONE: Add a section about the CSIRO experiments with cattle videos
    - DONE: Get some references for the classifier design process 

3. Previous work (review.tex)
    - Add some previous work about making classification algorithms
    - Reduce the feed efficiency bias

    - DONE: Split up section 3.3, it shouldn't be in this place

4. Outline
    - Fairly good but reference what was talked about in the background 
      wrt classifier design

    - The goals should be related to the framework, not the classifier. 

5 Method:
    - Flesh out a few of the headings
    - Put in pictures of the annotation interface

6 Discussion:
    - Detail the procedure used for doing feed effeciency experiment
        - Give results (eg accuracy)

    - Write about what went well 
    - Write about future improvements
        - Web interface
            - Eliminates package dependencies
            - Eliminates platform dependencies
            - More streamlined (don't need to connect to vpn)
        
        - Link to video
            - Annotate while looking at the video
